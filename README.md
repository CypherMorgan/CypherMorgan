# CypherMorgan — Junior Software QA Tester

Manual-first QA portfolio focused on clear bug reporting, exploratory testing, and regression coverage.

## What I do
- Manual testing (web & basic mobile workflows)
- Exploratory testing (charters, session notes, risk-based coverage)
- Regression testing (checklists + repeatable test runs)
- Bug reporting (repro steps, expected vs actual, impact, evidence)
- Beginner exposure to automation (learning fundamentals, not claiming automation ownership)

## Portfolio highlights
- **Bug reports & real issue work:** See **qa-bug-reports**
- **Manual QA artifacts (test cases, checklists, charters):** See **qa-manual-portfolio**

## Tools I use (junior-safe)
- Bug tracking: GitHub Issues
- Test documentation: Markdown / Google Docs-style formats
- API basics: Postman (beginner)
- SQL: basic querying for data validation
- Browser testing: Chrome DevTools, responsive checks, cross-browser sanity

## How I work
- Reproduce → isolate → document clearly
- Prioritize by user impact + frequency + risk
- Communicate calmly and precisely (no noise, no ego)
